# -Simple-implementation-of-Mobile-Former
Simple implementation of  Mobile-Former on Pytorch, it is different from the paper and may not be complete

At present, only the model but no trained, so there may be some problems during training. And there may be some bug in dyrelu ,cause the loss not change while add this module in model. I am try to find and solve these problems. If you have some suggestions about this, welcome to communicate
